React Components: These are the components that define the user interface of your application and are responsible for displaying information, interacting with users, and rendering the game state. Examples of components include:

Board: This component displays the game board and contains all the cards.
Card: This component represents a single game card and can be flipped or unflipped based on its state.
Modal: A component that displays notifications and messages to users, such as "Game Over" and to restart it.
Custom Hooks: These are the custom hooks you've created to manage the state and logic of the game. These may include:

useCard: This hook manages the state of the cards, such as flipped cards, matched cards, and handling clicks on cards.
useModal: A hook that manages the state and behavior of the notification and message modal.
API Communication Services: These are services responsible for interacting with the API, such as the Cat API or any other external service used to fetch the images of the game cards. These services may include:

fetchCards: A service that handles fetching the images of game cards from the Cat API or any similar external service.
CSS Styles: CSS styles for the application, used to define the appearance and design of components and the user interface.
